# CM_QA_assignment
The main test for computers Database was CRUD testing  (Create, Read, Update, and Delete. These are the four major and basic functions of persistent storage).
Create – INSERT an entry in Database (Create new computer)
Read or Retrieve – View an already existing Computer.
Update – Edit an already existing Computer.
Delete or Destroy – DROP/DELETE an already existing computer.

The test included functional and Non-functional testing.

For the automation Scripts. I used Selenium IDE and extracted the script from the scenario I made with Python language.

I also made a basic UML diagram (useCase) for compute Database.
